things I should look into more:
* day 15 part 2 -> i wrote this code in a state and it works but I couldn't tell you why or how
* graph traversals -> know how to spin up dijkstra's, a-star off the cuff (day 16)
* day 17 part 2 -> the reverse engineering makes sense but like, make it make more sense
